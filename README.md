# LinkedIn Clone

Welcome to the LinkedIn Clone project! This application is a modern replica of LinkedIn, built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It supports user interactions like posting, liking, commenting, and more, all while ensuring a responsive design and robust backend.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a sleek and adaptable user interface that works across devices.
- **Post Management**: Users can create, edit, and upload posts. They can also like, unlike, and comment on posts within their feed.
- **Google Sign-In**: Authentication is handled via [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/), integrating Google Sign-In for enhanced security and user convenience.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilizes [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) on Microsoft Azure for real-time data updates and scalability.
- **API Endpoints**: Developed robust API endpoints for handling data retrieval, submission, and deletion operations on the backend.
